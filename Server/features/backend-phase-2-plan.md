## Spec: Backend Phase 2 Plan

**Type**: `Feature`  
**Location**: `Server/features/backend-phase-2-plan.md`  
**Updated**: 2026-03-29  
**Status**: `In Progress`

---

### Purpose

> Define the first implementation slice after Phase 1 closure, focused on durability and security hardening.

---

### Phase 1 Inputs

- Phase 1 implementation steps 1 through 9 are complete.
- Step 9 client finalization commit:
- `bc99fdf chore(smoke): sync web auth paths and refreshed remote fixtures`
- Post-commit remote smoke passed on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

---

### Phase 2 Goals

1. Move session/domain state from in-memory runtime assumptions to durable persistence.
2. Enforce session lifecycle guarantees (expiry, revocation, recovery paths).
3. Add baseline auth hardening controls (rate-limit, audit log, operator tooling).
4. Preserve existing API contracts for web/mobile auth and current feature endpoints.

---

### Workstreams

1. Persistence Foundation
- Select storage approach and migration path.
- Introduce repository boundaries for auth/session and mutable feature data.
- Define seed/bootstrap strategy for local and smoke environments.

2. Session Lifecycle Hardening
- Enforce idle + absolute expiry checks on refresh.
- Add revocation lookup/write flow.
- Define logout/logout-all behavior for multi-session states.

3. Auth Security Hardening
- Add per-route rate limits for login/refresh endpoints.
- Capture audit events for auth success/failure and session mutation.
- Define minimal operator/admin revocation workflow.

4. Verification Expansion
- Add persistence-backed integration tests for auth core and transports.
- Add contract tests for `REFRESH_SESSION_*` and expiry/revocation error envelopes.
- Keep remote smoke path green with unchanged endpoint contracts.

---

### Initial Implementation Slice (Recommended)

1. Add pluggable persistence interfaces while keeping current in-memory adapter as fallback.
2. Wire auth core session/token operations through repository interfaces.
3. Add integration tests that run the same auth flow against persistence-backed adapters.
4. Re-run remote smoke and document outcomes in `Clinet/api/remote-smoke-test-results.md`.

### Implementation Progress (2026-03-29)

#### Completed in Slice 1

1. Persistence/Repository foundation
- Added pluggable persistence adapter with in-memory fallback.
- Added repository boundaries for auth/session and mutation-heavy features.

2. Session lifecycle hardening
- Added absolute + idle expiry checks.
- Added expiry-triggered revocation path for stale sessions.

3. Auth hardening baseline
- Added login/refresh rate limit controls.
- Added audit event capture for auth success/failure, rate-limit, and logout flows.

4. Verification expansion
- Added persistence-backed integration tests for web/mobile auth across restart.
- Added contract tests for `REFRESH_SESSION_EXPIRED` and `AUTH_RATE_LIMITED`.
- Re-ran remote smoke after implementation (`2026-03-29 10:23 KST`) and confirmed pass.

#### Next Slice

1. Expand operator tooling from single-user scope to bulk/criteria revoke workflows.
2. Add pagination/cursor model and retention policy controls for audit export.
3. Expand persistence-backed coverage for additional mutable feature domains.

---

### Slice 2 Progress (2026-03-29)

#### Completed

1. Operator revocation workflow
- Added operator-protected revoke endpoint:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/operator/sessions/revoke`
- Added operator-protected revoke-all endpoint:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/operator/sessions/revoke-all`
- Added explicit not-found contract for unknown user in revoke-all path.

2. Operator audit query/export
- Added operator-protected audit query endpoint:
- `GET /api/v1/operator/audit/events`
- Added operator-protected audit export endpoint:
- `GET /api/v1/operator/audit/events/export?format=jsonl`
- Added query validation for limit/clientType/timestamp filters.

3. Verification
- Added operator auth + revoke/revoke-all HTTP tests.
- Added operator audit query/export HTTP tests.
- Full server test suite passed (`node --test`, 30 tests).
- Remote smoke passed after slice-2 changes (`2026-03-29 12:14 KST`).

#### Next Slice

1. Add operator pagination/cursor and saved-filter support for audit tooling.
2. Add revoke-all-by-criteria workflows (clientType + time window + active-only guards).
3. Extend persistence-backed coverage to non-auth mutation domains.

### Out of Scope for First Slice

- Full analytics/event warehouse ingestion.
- Advanced anomaly detection and risk scoring.
- Multi-region replication.
