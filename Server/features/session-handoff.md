**Type**: `Feature`  
**Location**: `Server/features/session-handoff.md`  
**Updated**: 2026-03-29  
**Status**: `Ready`

---

### Purpose

> Capture completed backend work and the exact start point for the next session.

---

### Completed in This Phase

- Implemented server runtime baseline, router, and error envelope.
- Implemented shared auth core and token rotation.
- Implemented web auth endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/web/login`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/web/refresh`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/web/logout`
- Implemented mobile auth endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/mobile/login`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/mobile/refresh`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/mobile/logout`
- Implemented dashboard, curriculum, schedule, habit, analytics, and community read endpoints.
- Implemented dashboard/schedule/habit/community mutation endpoints.

---

### Verification Summary

- Server test suite (`node --test`) passes.
- Remote smoke path passed after auth path migration to `/api/v1/auth/web/*`.
- Fixture captures were updated on the frontend repo from real backend responses.
- Step 9 client finalization completed in `TheStudyLab`:
- `bc99fdf chore(smoke): sync web auth paths and refreshed remote fixtures`
- Post-commit smoke regression check passed against `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
- Phase 2 slice-1 regression check passed:
- `npm.cmd run smoke:remote -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8080` (`2026-03-29 10:23 KST`)

---

### Current Open Item

- Phase 2 slice-2 execution:
- operator-facing session revocation workflow
- audit event query/export path
- persistence-backed coverage expansion beyond auth core

---

### First Tasks for Next Session

1. Implement revoke/revoke-all workflow design in auth operational path.
2. Add audit event read model for troubleshooting and support use-cases.
3. Expand persistence-backed test scope to additional mutation domains.
