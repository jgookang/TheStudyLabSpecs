### Verification Summary

- Server test suite (`node --test`) passes.
- Remote smoke path passed after auth path migration to `/api/v1/auth/web/*`.
- Fixture captures were updated on the frontend repo from real backend responses.
- Step 9 client finalization completed in `TheStudyLab`:
- `bc99fdf chore(smoke): sync web auth paths and refreshed remote fixtures`
- Post-commit smoke regression check passed against `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
- Phase 2 slice-1 regression check passed:
- `npm.cmd run smoke:remote -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8080` (`2026-03-29 10:23 KST`)
- Phase 2 slice-2 regression check passed:
- `npm.cmd run smoke:remote -- --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8080` (`2026-03-29 12:14 KST`)
- Phase 2 slice-3 verification passed:
- `node --test` (`34/34`)
- Remote smoke was not re-run in this sandbox session due process spawn policy restriction.
- Last known smoke pass remains `2026-03-29 12:14 KST`.
- Phase 3 kickoff verification passed:
- `node --test` (`38/38`)
- Added audit retention policy controls and criteria revoke approval-token workflow.
- Inline remote smoke sequence passed (`2026-03-29 13:47 KST`) on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
- Published operator security runbook with environment defaults and approval failure handling:
- `Server/backend/operator-security-runbook.md`

---

### Current Open Item

- Remote smoke re-run outside sandbox-restricted shell and result capture.
- Apply runbook defaults to deployment environment variables (staging/production).
- Capture one operator dry-run + execute evidence sample in ops notes.

---

### First Tasks for Next Session

1. Re-run remote smoke and sync latest timestamp in `Clinet/api/remote-smoke-test-results.md`.
2. Apply staging/production env var defaults from `Server/backend/operator-security-runbook.md`.
3. Capture operator criteria revoke execution evidence for incident runbook appendix.
